# To Do List, static version in React

> This project is a static version of the previous To-Do List application (created in other [public repository](https://mg-wiewiora.github.io/to-do-list-improved/)). The main goal was to migrate the existing HTML and CSS structure to the **React framework** to focus purely on component architecture.

> This project was created as part of learning Front-end fundamentals.

> Language of the page: **Polish**

## Demo

## Functionality (Static View)

This version is **visual-only** and does not contain any active JavaScript logic (tasks cannot be added, marked as done, or deleted yet).

**Key Features:**

* **Component Architecture:** The application view is divided into separate, reusable components (e.g., `Form`, `List`, `Menu`).
* **Structure Migration:** Successful translation of the existing semantic HTML structure into JSX.
* **CSS Preservation:** Retention of all original CSS styling and layout.

---

## Technologies

This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of component-based architecture.

* **Framework:** **React**
* **Structure:** **JSX** (JavaScript XML) for defining component structure.
* **Styling:** Standard **CSS** (imported directly) utilizing previous BEM conventions.

## Learning Points & Focus

This project provided crucial practical experience with:

1.  **Component Thinking:** Breaking down a complex UI (the To-Do List) into smaller, manageable components.
2.  **JSX Syntax:** Understanding and applying the syntax rules for combining HTML-like code with JavaScript.
3.  **Setup and Build:** Successfully setting up a basic React environment and deploying it (via GitHub Pages).
4.  **Props Introduction:** Learning how to pass static data down through components (though logic is not yet implemented).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
